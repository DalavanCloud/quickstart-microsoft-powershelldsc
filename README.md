## Windows PowerShell DSC on the AWS Cloud


This Quick Start deploys a highly available Windows PowerShell Desired State Configuration (PowerShell DSC) environment in the AWS Cloud.

PowerShell DSC enables you to express the desired state of your systems using declarative language syntax instead of complex imperative scripts. You can use PowerShell DSC with AWS CloudFormation to bootstrap and configure servers and apps for your software platform on AWS.

The Quick Start offers two deployment options:

- Deploying a pull server architecture on AWS
- Deploying a push server architecture on AWS

You can also use the AWS CloudFormation templates as a starting point for your own implementation.
